# Quantum Physics Experiments

This folder contains quantum-themed simulations using Python and matplotlib animations to visualize foundational physics concepts.

## Included Experiments

### 1. Wave Function Collapse Simulation  
**File:** `wave-function-collapse-simulation.ipynb`  
Simulates photons being detected on a screen, first forming an interference pattern, and then suddenly transitioning into a uniform distribution due to a simulated wave function collapse.

**Features:**
- Real-time visualization with a "flash" at the moment of collapse.
- Histograms show photon impacts evolving over time.

---

### 2. Double-Slit Experiment Simulation (Quantum Interference)  
**File:** `double-slit-experiment.ipynb`  
Visualizes quantum interference patterns by simulating photons passing through a double-slit setup and being detected on a screen.

**Features:**
- Animated detection pattern evolving with each photon.
- No wave function collapse â€” continuous interference pattern.

### 3. Quantum Harmonic Oscillator Simulation  
**File:** `quantum-harmonic-oscillator-visualization.ipynb`  
Simulates the quantum harmonic oscillator using Hermite polynomial wave functions and visualizes their evolution.

**Features:**
- Interactive or animated wavefunction visualization.
- Adjustable quantum energy levels.
- Educational representation of stationary states in a harmonic potential.

### 4. Gravitational Lensing Simulation  
**File:** `gravitational-lensing-simulation.ipynb`  
Simulates the gravitational lensing effect produced by a black hole bending light from a distant galaxy or star.

**Features:**
- Visual representation of distorted light paths due to gravitational fields.
- Interactive or animated visualization of lensing intensity.
- Inspired by general relativity concepts.
