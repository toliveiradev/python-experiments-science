# Wave Function Collapse Simulation

This experiment simulates the behavior of photons in a quantum interference scenario (like the double-slit experiment), with a visual representation of wave function collapse over time.

## What is Simulated
- Photons traveling toward a screen and forming an interference pattern.
- Wave function collapse is simulated in real-time (with a visual "flash" effect).
- The photon distribution changes from an interference pattern to a random pattern after the collapse.

## How to Run the Experiment
You can run the experiment locally or in any environment that supports Jupyter notebooks (such as Deepnote, Google Colab, or Jupyter Lab).

### Steps to Run:
1. Clone this repository and navigate to the `quantum-physics` directory:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/toliveiradev/python-experiments-science.git
   cd python-experiments-science/quantum-physics
