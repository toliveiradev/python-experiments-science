# Quantum Physics Experiments

This folder contains quantum-themed simulations using Python and matplotlib animations to visualize foundational physics concepts.

## Included Experiments

### 1. Wave Function Collapse Simulation

**File:** `wave-function-collapse-simulation.ipynb`

Simulates photons being detected on a screen, first forming an interference pattern, and then suddenly transitioning into a uniform distribution due to a simulated wave function collapse.

**Features:**
- Real-time visualization with a "flash" at the moment of collapse.
- Histograms show photon impacts evolving over time.

### 2. Double-Slit Experiment Simulation (Quantum Interference)

**File:** `double-slit-experiment.ipynb`

Visualizes quantum interference patterns by simulating photons passing through a double-slit setup and being detected on a screen.

**Features:**
- Animated detection pattern evolving with each photon.
- No wave function collapse â€” continuous interference pattern.
