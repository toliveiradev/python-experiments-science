## Getting Started

To run the notebook and simulations locally, follow the steps below:

1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/python-experiments-science.git
cd python-experiments-science
```

2. Create a Virtual Environment (optional but recommended)
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use: venv\Scripts\activate
```

3. Install Dependencies
Install all required Python packages using requirements.txt:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. Run Jupyter Notebook
Start the Jupyter Notebook server:
```bash
jupyter notebook
```

This will open the Jupyter interface in your web browser. From there, navigate to the experiment you want to run, for example:
```bash
quantum-physics/wave-function-collapse-simulation.ipynb
```
